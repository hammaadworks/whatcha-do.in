# whatcha-doin

## Project Overview
This is a minimal GitHub repository that was imported into Replit. Currently, it contains only configuration files for Gemini AI agent workflows, but no actual application code.

## Current State (November 19, 2025)
- **Status**: Configuration-only repository
- **No application code**: There are no source files (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, etc.)
- **No build system**: No package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency files
- **No workflows configured**: No runnable application at this time

## Repository Contents
- `.gemini/` - Gemini AI configuration files
  - `AGENTS.md` - Agent memory and preferences
  - `settings.json` - Gemini settings including MCP servers
  - `commands/` - Various TOML configuration files for different agent roles
- `README.md` - Project title only
- `.replit` - Basic Replit configuration

## Based on AGENTS.md Configuration
The configuration suggests the project might eventually include:
- React/TypeScript application
- State management with Zustand
- UI components from Magic UI and Aceternity UI
- WhatsApp integration functionality
- Documentation in `docs/` folder (PRD.md, ux-design-specification.md, architecture.md)

## Next Steps
Since there's no application code to run:
1. Decide what application to build based on the project name "whatcha-doin"
2. Set up the appropriate technology stack
3. Create the necessary files and structure
4. Configure workflows and deployment

## User Preferences (from AGENTS.md)
- User name: hammaadworks
- Communication language: English
- TypeScript type checking required
- Documentation-driven development (PRD, UX specs, architecture)
